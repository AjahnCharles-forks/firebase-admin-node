## auth.BaseAuth.deleteUsers() method

Deletes the users specified by the given uids.

Deleting a non-existing user won't generate an error (i.e. this method is idempotent.) Non-existing users are considered to be successfully deleted, and are therefore counted in the `DeleteUsersResult.successCount` value.

Only a maximum of 1000 identifiers may be supplied. If more than 1000 identifiers are supplied, this method throws a FirebaseAuthError.

This API is currently rate limited at the server to 1 QPS. If you exceed this, you may get a quota exceeded error. Therefore, if you want to delete more than 1000 users, you may need to add a delay to ensure you don't go over this limit.
