## auth.SAMLAuthProviderConfig.x509Certificates property

The list of SAML IdP X.509 certificates issued by CA for this provider. Multiple certificates are accepted to prevent outages during IdP key rotation (for example ADFS rotates every 10 days). When the Auth server receives a SAML response, it will match the SAML response with the certificate on record. Otherwise the response is rejected. Developers are expected to manage the certificate updates as keys are rotated.
