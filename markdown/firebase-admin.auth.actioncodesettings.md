|  [android](./firebase-admin.auth.actioncodesettings.android.md) | { packageName: string; installApp?: boolean; minimumVersion?: string; } | Defines the Android package name. This will try to open the link in an android app if it is installed. If <code>installApp</code> is passed, it specifies whether to install the Android app if the device supports it and the app is not already installed. If this field is provided without a <code>packageName</code>, an error is thrown explaining that the <code>packageName</code> must be provided in conjunction with this field. If <code>minimumVersion</code> is specified, and an older version of the app is installed, the user is taken to the Play Store to upgrade the app. |
