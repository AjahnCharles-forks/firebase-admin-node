## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [aud](./firebase-admin.auth.decodedidtoken.aud.md) | string | The audience for which this token is intended.<!-- -->This value is a string equal to your Firebase project ID, the unique identifier for your Firebase project, which can be found in \[your project's settings\](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/\_/settings/general/android:com.random.android). |
|  [auth\_time](./firebase-admin.auth.decodedidtoken.auth_time.md) | number | Time, in seconds since the Unix epoch, when the end-user authentication occurred.<!-- -->This value is not set when this particular ID token was created, but when the user initially logged in to this session. In a single session, the Firebase SDKs will refresh a user's ID tokens every hour. Each ID token will have a different \[<code>iat</code>\](\#iat) value, but the same <code>auth_time</code> value. |
|  [email\_verified](./firebase-admin.auth.decodedidtoken.email_verified.md) | boolean | Whether or not the email of the user to whom the ID token belongs is verified, provided the user has an email. |
|  [email](./firebase-admin.auth.decodedidtoken.email.md) | string | The email of the user to whom the ID token belongs, if available. |
|  [exp](./firebase-admin.auth.decodedidtoken.exp.md) | number | The ID token's expiration time, in seconds since the Unix epoch. That is, the time at which this ID token expires and should no longer be considered valid.<!-- -->The Firebase SDKs transparently refresh ID tokens every hour, issuing a new ID token with up to a one hour expiration. |
|  [firebase](./firebase-admin.auth.decodedidtoken.firebase.md) | { identities: { \[key: string\]: any; }; sign\_in\_provider: string; sign\_in\_second\_factor?: string; second\_factor\_identifier?: string; tenant?: string; \[key: string\]: any; } | Information about the sign in event, including which sign in provider was used and provider-specific identity details.<!-- -->This data is provided by the Firebase Authentication service and is a reserved claim in the ID token. |
|  [iat](./firebase-admin.auth.decodedidtoken.iat.md) | number | The ID token's issued-at time, in seconds since the Unix epoch. That is, the time at which this ID token was issued and should start to be considered valid.<!-- -->The Firebase SDKs transparently refresh ID tokens every hour, issuing a new ID token with a new issued-at time. If you want to get the time at which the user session corresponding to the ID token initially occurred, see the \[<code>auth_time</code>\](\#auth\_time) property. |
|  [iss](./firebase-admin.auth.decodedidtoken.iss.md) | string | The issuer identifier for the issuer of the response.<!-- -->This value is a URL with the format <code>https://securetoken.google.com/&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;</code> is the same project ID specified in the \[<code>aud</code>\](\#aud) property. |
|  [phone\_number](./firebase-admin.auth.decodedidtoken.phone_number.md) | string | The phone number of the user to whom the ID token belongs, if available. |

|  [uid](./firebase-admin.auth.decodedidtoken.uid.md) | string | The <code>uid</code> corresponding to the user who the ID token belonged to.<!-- -->This value is not actually in the JWT token claims itself. It is added as a convenience, and is set as the value of the \[<code>sub</code>\](\#sub) property. |
